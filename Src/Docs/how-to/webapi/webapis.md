# Http WebAPI and REST API

The WebApi is a set of http APIs which let you access content-items, lists of items, queries or even custom C# APIs. 

> [!TIP]
> Before you start, make sure you are familiar with the [Specs](xref:Specs.WebApi.Intro) and the [URL Schema](xref:Specs.WebApi.UrlSchema).


## Get Started

Your 1-2-3 steps for using data endpoints are:

1. Decide which endpoint you need
1. Create / Publish the endpoint
   1. For standard endpoints, set the permissions as you need them
   1. For custom endpoints, write the C# code
1. Write the code to read the data (typically in JavaScript)

## Decide which Endpoint you need
