# Web API Documentation for 2sxc

2sxc has a fully featured WebApi for use in JavaScript or as Headless CMS. So you can call HTTP `GET` to an endpoint like `app/News/NewsItems/` and get a list of news items. 

You can also create / modify data using REST, access Queries and work with your custom Web-APIs - across all 2sxc platforms (Dnn / Oqtane / Custom) and with the security you need.
