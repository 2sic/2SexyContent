# Data Type: Empty

## Purpose / Description
Empty data is a basic [data type](data-types) and is for adding things to the UI (input form) which doesn't actually save any data. A common use is group-headers which contain a text, but don't result in data being stored.  

## Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model
This is not stored, as it is specifically meant to not store data. 

## Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model
This is not stored, as it is specifically meant to not store data. 

## Notes and Clarifications
Since this is a very trivial data-type, there is currently no additional documentation.
