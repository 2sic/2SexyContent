# Concept: Content-Types (Schemas, Object-Types)

## Purpose / Description

Every _thing_, _record_ or _object_ in 2sxc has a definition of fields it can have. So a `Book` may have fields like Name, Author, Title etc. This defininition of the _Type_ is called a **Content-Type**. Other systems referr to it as the _Schema_, _Object-Type_ or _Table Definition_. 

## How it Works

Each [Entity](concept-entities) has many fields, some containing text, numbers etc. The fields an Entity can have is defined in the **Content-Type**, so each Entity is like a record of that type. The Content-Type will define what fields exist, what is required and what order the fields will appear in when editing the item. 

Each field will be of a simple type like _text/string_, _number_, _boolean (yes/no)_ or other. You can find the list of [types here](data-types).
