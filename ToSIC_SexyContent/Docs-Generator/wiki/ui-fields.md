# UI Field Types

## Purpose / Description
The UI has many field types, most of which are not especially documented. Here's what's currently documented.

## Main Types
Click on the type to discover more about this type, and to learn about the sub-types

1. [All](ui-field-all) - not really a field-type, but contains core information about a field like name, help-text and more
1. [Boolean](ui-field-boolean) - a basic yes/on input field
1. Custom - a custom data-type, currently for internal use only (specs may change)
1. [DateTime](ui-field-datetime) - a basic date/time input field
1. [Empty](ui-field-empty) - a UI-only field for things like grouping fields together under a title
1. [Entity](ui-field-entity) - an item-picker field to choose existing items
1. Hyperlink - a link field - this is internally stored as a string, but is modified when being used
1. [Number](ui-field-number) - a general number field
1. [String](ui-field-string) - a general string field

## History
1. Introduced in EAV 1.0 / 2sxc 1.0
2. Changed continously - most of it in EAV 2-4 which matches 2sxc 4, 6 and 9
