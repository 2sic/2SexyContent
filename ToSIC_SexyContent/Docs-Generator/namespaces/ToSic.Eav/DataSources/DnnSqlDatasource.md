# Data Source: DnnSqlDataSource

The **DnnSqlDataSource** [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard DNN Data Sources](xref:Specs.DataSources.ListAll). It lets you use data from the DNN SQL databases as if they were entities. 

This is what it looks like:

## How to use 
Internally the DnnSqlDataSource is exactly the same as the [SqlDataSource](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource) just with fewer options, because you cannot choose most of the settings. Please consult the [SqlDataSource documentation](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource) to see how you can use it.
