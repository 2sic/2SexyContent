# Data Type: String

## Purpose / Description
String data is a basic [data type](xref:Specs.Data.Type.Overview) and is very commonly used in many fields. It's used for any basic kind of text, be it a character, a single-line text or wysiwyg-content. 

## Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model
This is simply stored as a string in the DB.

## Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model
This is simply stored as a JSON string.

## Notes and Clarifications
Since this is a very trivial data-type, there is currently no additional documentation.
