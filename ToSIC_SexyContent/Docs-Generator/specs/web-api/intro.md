# Introduction to WebAPI and REST APIs

To use 2sxc/EAV data in JavaScript, from Mobile Apps or from other websites you need **endpoints** which will provide the data. 2sxc and EAV have everything prepared to make this easy for you and to ensure security - especially to ensure you only publish data you intend to publish.

A few terms to clarify before we begin:

- [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) means that there is a url convention to access data like `.../blogposts/25`
- [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) also specifies that an _HTTP GET_ is for reading, _HTTP POST_ is for writing, etc.
- All the APIs use [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for sending/receiving data. [This is the default schema](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/2zBGrCAd).

## Standard Content/Entity REST Endpoints

These endpoints already exist and allow normal CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. To use them, you would need to enable the permissions and then you can access them using the REST URLs.

## Standard Query REST Endpoints

Every Visual Query you create has a REST URL. If you set the permissions, you can then read from the Query through REST. You can also pass query-parameters in the URL.

## Custom C# WebAPI

You can easily create custom C# WebAPIs, and then access them through the URL. What these endpoints do is completely up to you.







Once you have opened the security on a standard endpoint or once you have created your custom endpoint, you can then access it from JavaScript, Mobile Apps or external systems.

## History

1. Introduced in 2sxc ca. 5.x
2. Enhanced with Polymorph Editions in 2sxc 9.35 (allowing subfolder/api)
