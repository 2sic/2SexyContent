# Customizing the Form - WIP v11!

2sxc comes with thousands of features, and the more we add, the more features are requested ðŸ˜‰. So it's important that you can implement many of these things yourself. Here's an overview over what's possible & how, + what's in store. 


## Create Custom Input Fields

This has been completely reworked in 2sxc 11. For now, please...

* Read the [How-To](xref:HowTo.Customize.EditUx)
* Check out the ]Tutorial Examples](https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/en/razor/ui/home)
* Read the Blog post
* Read about [customizing the WYSIWYG](xref:Specs.Form.Field.Wysiwyg)

TODO:


## Outlook / Roadmap

* We're trying to ensure that this is super-stable and that the API won't change any more. that's priority #1
* Then we want to build a rule/formula engine to calculate field values or set show/hide rules
