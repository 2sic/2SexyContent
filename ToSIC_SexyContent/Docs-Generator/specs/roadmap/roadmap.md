# Roadmap of EAV and 2sxc - Vision of the Future

The 2sxc roadmap contains the things we think are fairly important to tackle next. Since we're all working for free, there is no commitment to do this in the order you see below. And sometimes a customer will need a feature quickly - and pay for it - then it will appear sooner. _You too can sponsor a feature!_

## Next Priorities (EOY 2019 and 2020 Q1)

1. Create this site (docs.2sxc.org) and migrate much of the old wiki into this
1. Build new Admin-UI based on Angular 8


## Old Notes - TODO must sort
these things must be re-organized, as they were the old roadmap. A lot has been implemented, but someone must update these docs.

### Version 9.?
* [ ] ability for templates to support multiple CSS frameworks at once

### Version 9.?
* [ ] RelationshipItems DataSource
* [ ] Files DataSource
* [ ] ADAM DataSource
* [ ] Pages DataSource
* [ ] Navigation DataSource

### Version 9.? - Angular5 Upgrade
* [ ] migrate quick-dialog to Angular 5
* [ ] built-in support for Angular 5


### Version 9.? - app-level JSON content-types
* [ ] Enable slow (hybrid) migration of existing (installed) system-types to new json-types
* [ ] Provide ability for Apps to also include app-level json types
* [ ] Import json content-type

### Version 9.? - In-Page List-Management
* [ ] Provide functionality to add/remove items in sub-lists (like tags) of an item, directly on the page

### Version 9.? - Anonymous Data Creation
* [ ] Ability to use WebAPIs to create data from end-users, automatically saving that data as draft
* [ ] Ability to use WebAPIs to edit data for certain user groups, automatically saving changes as draft

### Version 9.? - TypeScript Upgrade
* [ ] Refactor on-page JavaScript code to use TypeScript
* [ ] Enhance toolbar generation to provide "default-toolbar-with-minor-changes"
* [ ] Provide typings for all kinds of toolbar-generationg JS, making it easier to create custom toolbars
 
## Future

* [ ] ...or whatever is needed next :)
